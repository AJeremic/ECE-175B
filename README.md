This project was to create a VAE in pytorch, here I used a small dataset of only a few thousand images of size 256x256. The number of pixels greatly outweighs the number of training images, often this
is a problem for training and it can be difficult to make a deep and accurate model on such small training set. Then I used information learned from the class on FID and inception scores to measure the
quality of the training of the model.
